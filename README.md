This script was written as a Linux tool to check a file system for image files, gather a list of all present image files within that FS, then present them to a user via a web page. Via the webpage they may note items of interest and generate those items into a report. This script was written in Linux using Python v2.7. It was a foray into creating a "forensic" tool. Something that may be used for preview, to quick see everything present on a suspect FS and then report items of interest in PDF format.
